# Explore ENOWA - Enabler User Story Repository

## enowa-gis-explorer

This Git repository is dedicated to Explore ENOWA, serving as an enabler for user stories related to Geographic Information System (GIS) development. As the Product Owner, having a centralized GitHub repository allows for streamlined version control and easy collaboration among the development team.

### Repository Initialization

The repository has been initialized with a README file to provide essential information about the project. The initial commit includes a basic directory structure that reflects the organization of the Explore ENOWA project. Git has been initialized within the repository, enabling version control for the EGDB (Enterprise Geodatabase) project.

### Repository Access

The Product Owner has administrative access to the repository, ensuring control over the project's development and management. Development team members are added as collaborators with appropriate access permissions, such as read and write, based on their roles in the project.

### Branching Strategy

A default branch (e.g., main or master) has been established. Feature branches are employed for the development of new features or enhancements, while bug fix branches are created to address issues and bugs in the system.

### Contribution Guidelines

To facilitate a collaborative development process, a CONTRIBUTING.md file has been added to the repository. This file outlines guidelines for contributing code, ensuring a consistent and efficient workflow for the development team.

### Code Review Procedures

The repository documents code review procedures, emphasizing the importance of peer reviews before merging changes. This ensures code quality, adherence to coding standards, and knowledge sharing within the development team.

### Project Documentation

A dedicated 'docs' directory has been created within the repository to host project documentation. Basic documentation, including a project overview, installation instructions, and usage guidelines, is provided to assist both contributors and users.

### Issue Tracking

The repository features an "Issues" section to track and manage tasks, bugs, and enhancements. Issues are labeled appropriately (e.g., bug, enhancement, task) for better organization and prioritization of development efforts.

Explore ENOWA is an evolving project, and contributions from the development team are encouraged. Together, let's build a robust and user-friendly GIS solution!
